Startup BLINK wants to provide cryptocurrency payment services. At the same time, BLINK also acts as an exchanger of cryptocurrency for fiat currency. The problem is that BLINK gives the profit to the stores once a week in Georgian lari, but keeps the profit in USDT. Due to a sharp change in the exchange rate, BLINK may incur losses.

Using the Jupyter development environment, I [estimated](./USD_GEL.md) the probability of a change in the exchange rate of the Georgian lari against the dollar. I used the course change [history](./USD_GEL_Historical_Data.csv) from 2015 for this.

This assessment can be useful for risk accounting and commission determination.
